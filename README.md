# r/Place Bot
Created on April 1st by Aidan Comi

### Inspriation
Created to help Discord servers share cordinates for the [r/Place](https://reddit.com/r/place) subreddit. This is my first discord bot, and I'm not experienced in Python at all, so please open an issue if you notice any problems at all!

### How it works
The bot will search through new messages that contains what it suspects are r/Place coordinates, if found it will send a message with the corresponding link. To prevent false positives, the bot will only recognize coordinates contained in parentheses. Ex. (129, 234)

### How to use
Simply click the link [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=959523533493518356&scope=bot&permissions=3072) to add to your server.

### Setup
This will always be open-source as long as I run the project. I am currently hosting on Replit and plan to run it till April 5.

### Contact
Please feel free to email me at [placebot@comidev.com](mailto:placebot@comidev.com) for any questions at all! I am a college student and this is a side project, so please excuse any mistakes!

Note: r/Place Bot was not created or is endorsed by Reddit or r/Place. This bot will not fill in pixels for your and does not to any automation on Reddit's site. This is only for Discord.
